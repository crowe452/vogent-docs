Voice Cloning

Vogent offers advanced voice cloning technology that allows you to create custom voices for your applications. Voice cloning enables you to create a digital voice that sounds like a specific person, providing a personalized and unique experience for your users.

Only clone a voice if you have explicit permission from the voice owner.

How Voice Cloning Works

Go to the _Voices_ tab on the left sidebar, then click on _Clone Voice_. Select the voice model from the dropdown menu, then upload a sample of the voice that you’d like to clone. 10-30 seconds of audio is recommended for the best results.

Sesame Voice Cloning

To get the best results with Sesame, it’s recommended to use a clip with 10-20 seconds of conversational audio. Pauses, disfluencies, etc. are all helpful for the model to learn the natural flow of speech; these should not be tagged in the transcript (e.g. don’t include “uh” in the reference text). The following is an example of a good reference text; to clone your own voice, try reading this:

> Like revising for an exam I’d have to try and like keep up the momentum because I’d start really early I’d be like okay I’m gonna start revising now and then like you’re revising for ages.
