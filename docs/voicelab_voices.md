# Voices and Voice Cloning

Browse the voice library and learn about voice cloning options

While you can bring any voice to any of our offered models by voice-cloning, we also offer select pre-cloned and pre-trained voices for each model. Voices marked as **High Quality** are full fine-tunes from professional voice actors, and will be higher quality & more stable. Other voices are zero-shot voice clones; while still high-quality, they may be more likely to produce artifacts in generation.

Voice Cloning

There are two ways to clone a voice: **zero-shot voice-cloning** involves providing 15-20 seconds of a high-quality recording, while **professional voice-cloning (or fine-tuning)** involves 2-3 hours of two speakers engaged in conversation. While professional voice-cloning produces higher-fidelity clones with fewer quirks/artifacts, zero-shot voice cloning can usually produce a good result. The quality of voice clones can depend on the style of the voice you’re trying to clone; voices that are too far out-of-distribution (i.e. voices whose accents/styles were not likely encountered during initial training of the model) are more likely to produce lower-fidelity voice clones, or voice clones with more artifacts.

Zero-Shot Voice Cloning

You can generate a zero-shot voice clone by uploading a 15-20 second voice recording through our UI. To do so, go to the **Voices** tab on the left sidebar, then click the **Clone Voice** button. Select a gender and voice model, then upload the clip.

Voice Cloning Tips

  * Make sure your clip is free from background noise, and that there is only one speaker
  * _For best results, upload a conversational clip_. Don’t over-enunciate or artificially control the speed of speech.
  * _Keep in mistakes (stutters, ums/uhs, etc.)_. These lead to more realistic clones.
  * For best results, improvise some lines on a topic that’s easy for you to speak about (e.g. what are your plans for this weekend?)
  * Do not read from a script.
