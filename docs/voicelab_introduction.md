Voicelab Overview

Welcome to Voicelab! Vogent Voicelab is an API for optimized inference of top text-to-speech models, like Sesame’s CSM-1B, Dia, Orpheus, and more.

Why use Voicelab?

New open-source text-to-speech models come out every week, with many ranking as state-of-the-art on popular benchmarks. However, most of these models are not readily usable for high-volume, low-latency inference. Additionally, some research preview models can struggle with hallucinations and inconsistent outputs. Finally, as with any model, hosting yourself and managing compute can be a headache. Voicelab solves these problems:

  1. Voicelab maintains a proprietary inference stack that is optimized to serve text-to-speech transformers efficiently and scalably.
  2. Voicelab post-trains select models to improve consistency and offer high-quality professional voice clones.
  3. Voicelab manages all compute, so you can pay for these models per-character instead of managing GPUs.
