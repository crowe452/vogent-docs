Platform Overview

# Live Dials

Connect into live calls

If you’d like to view all calls that are currently running, you can do so by clicking the **Live Dials** tab in the left sidebar. To patch into a call, click the **Listen** button next to the call you’d like to hop into. From here, you can pause the agent by clicking the pause icon and/or speak to the counterparty yourself by unmuting.

While paused, every line in the conversation will still get added to the agent’s context. This way, if you choose to unpause the agent, it will continue the conversation from the transfer point.
