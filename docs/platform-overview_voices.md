Discover available voices

We recently launched realtime ultra-realistic voices using a redesigned version of Sesame’s CSM-1B model. To learn more about using Sesame voices, see the [Sesame](/platform-overview/voices/sesame) page.

Vogent offers a wide range of voices, and adds new ones regularly. You can browse available voices by clicking the **Voices** tab in the left sidebar. You can search voices by name and filter by tag. If you’d like to select a voice for use in the API, you can copy the voice ID and use it in your API requests. Along with self-explanatory tags (e.g. gender, accent), there are a couple of special tags:

  * **Price Tiers** : Voices are grouped into two price tiers: Standard and Premium. Premium voices come with an additional per-minute charge.
  * **Spelling** : Voices with the **Spelling** tag are optimized to spell words and numbers naturally.



Can’t find a voice that fits your needs? Contact us or let us know on Discord and we can explore adding a voice that works for you. Our Enterprise tier comes with custom-trained voices.
