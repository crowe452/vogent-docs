# Billing

How we charge for Vogent

Vogent charges for usage on a pay-as-you-go basis, metered by the second. You’re billed for the number of minutes your agents spend on calls, at one of two rates (based on the voice you’ve selected):

  * **Standard Voices** : $0.09 per minute ($0.0015 per second)
  * **Premium Voices** : $0.14 per minute ($0.0023 per second)



If you’re planning on making calls at scale (~5-10,000+ calls per month), you’ll likely benefit from the volume discounts in our Enterprise plan.

The **Billing** tab on the left sidebar lets you view your billing information and usage history.
