Learn about Sesame voice technology

We provide access to Sesame’s ultra-realistic CSM-1B voice model, through a rebuilt version that can produce audio in real-time and at low-latency. This voice engine is available at no additional cost. In testing, the voice generally surpasses state-of-the-art voice vendors in realism, while beating them on cost and latency.

Using Sesame Voices

Sesame voices can be identified by the “Sesame” tag in the voice selection interface. While there are a small number of available Sesame voices right now, **cloning Sesame voices** is straightforward, and can be done with ~8-20 seconds of audio. For tips on effectively creating new Sesame voices, see the [Voice Cloning](/platform-overview/voices/voice-cloning#sesame-voice-cloning) section.

Sesame voices are still in beta, and may still have instability in inference (e.g. long pauses, or strange conversational artifacts). We regularly release updates that enhance their capabilities and performance.
